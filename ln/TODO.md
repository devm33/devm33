    - maybe change to actual bullets
    - used the squint check

    - one or two lines, e.g Skills: Javascript for progressive enhacement and
      client-side webapps, Python, Scala, Java, Clojure, SQL databases as well
      as mongo. See more at linkedin.com/in/devrajmehta and github.com/devm33

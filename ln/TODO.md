# TODO

- would like some way of identifying whether what's live is latest (maybe add a git tag to the _oy script)
- [WIP] add a little progressive enhancement pjax :)
- find jekyll plugin to gzip everything (html,css,js)
- add csp from here https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/
- remove text next to logos in footer, single file logos, make them larger
- add travis tests! http://garthdb.com/writings/i-am-a-jekyll-god/

## Resume

- better line spacing (less content indigestion)
    - maybe change to actual bullets
    - used the squint check
- clean up skills section
    - one or two lines, e.g Skills: Javascript for progressive enhacement and
      client-side webapps, Python, Scala, Java, Clojure, SQL databases as well
      as mongo. See more at linkedin.com/in/devrajmehta and github.com/devm33
- writing: focus more on results rather than duties/tasks

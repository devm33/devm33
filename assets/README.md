## Folder to organize creation and alteration of assets for this website.

- `favico_sprite` contains the originals to create the `favico_sprite.png` image
and documents the process of doing so.

- `s3` is a mirror of the asset files I store on aws s3 along with notes on
managing them.

- `working` is a collection of original or working files for reference or
reuse.

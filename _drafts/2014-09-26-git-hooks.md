### .git/hooks/

Git hooks are awesome. On a team I used to work in we kept a post-it note on
our sprint board for the task of "Automate Everything." While it did have
infinity story points it has remained a mantra that I work towards everyday.

As part of that effort I have found that git hooks are particularly useful.
Since the entirety of my software development inside and outside work is
tracked in git it's a natural place to automate aspects of the development
workflow, especially any part of the git workflow.

So here's a quick post about where and how I use git hooks. The overall how
is very simple and straightforward:

1. Write a script to automate a part of the workflow that occurs before
after any particular git action.

1. Symlink that script to a file in `.git/hooks/` named for the git action
being used as a signal as documented here:
<http://git-scm.com/docs/githooks>

1. Enjoy life automated.

### prepare-commit-msg


Quick background, at my current job we use the [Atlassian software
suite][atlassian], specifically in my case [Stash][stash] for hosting git repos,
managing pull requests, etc. and [Jira][jira] creating and tracking issues. One
development practice that the group I'm in follows is prepending all commit
messages with the Jira ticket number that the work is for, such as

    PROJ-#### fixed everything.

where #### is the ticket number and PROJ is the abreviation for the
project in Jira. This then allows Stash to generate nice links on commit
messages to the Jira tickets. In addition to that we also use feature branches
with the following format:

    ####__short_description_of_issue

where again #### is the ticket number of the issue. So we have the ticket
number handy in the branch number. So here's the git hook.

{% highlight bash %}

#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
#
# Prepend commit messages with ticket number

message_file=$1

current_message=$(cat $message_file)

branch=$(git symbolic-ref -q HEAD)

number=$(echo $branch | sed -n 's/^.*\([0-9]\{4\}\)__.*$/\1/p')

# grep check to avoid double tapping
grep -qs "^PROJ" $message_file ||
    echo "PROJ-$number $current_message" > $message_file

{% endhighlight %}
